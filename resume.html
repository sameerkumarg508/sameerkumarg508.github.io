          <h3>Project 4: Business Case: Walmart Customer Purchase Behaviour Analysis</h3>
          <p>Walmart, a retail giant, aims to understand customer spending behaviour during Black Friday by comparing male and female
            customers' purchase amounts. The analysis involves data exploration, detection of null values and outliers, calculation of
            average spending for males and females, the use of the Central Limit Theorem to compute confidence intervals, and assessing
            whether these intervals overlap. The results will help Walmart make data-driven decisions and improvements. Additionally,
            similar analyses are conducted for marital status and age groups, providing further insights. The outcome is a set of actionable
            recommendations for Walmart to enhance its marketing and sales strategies based on customers' spending patterns</p>

          <h3>Project 5: Business Case: Yulu - Hypothesis Testing</h3>
          <p>In this business case for Yulu, a leading micro-mobility service provider in India, the objective is to analyse the factors
            influencing the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market. The dataset provided contains information on various
            attributes such as season, holiday, weather, temperature, user counts, and more. The analysis begins with exploratory data
            analysis (EDA), including data structure assessment, data type conversions, missing value detection, and statistical
            summaries. EDA also explores the relationships between variables like working day, season, and weather with the count of
            electric cycles rented, providing insights into the data's distribution and characteristics. Hypothesis testing is performed using
            a 2-Sample T-Test to assess the impact of working days on rental counts, ANOVA to evaluate differences in rental counts
            across different weather conditions and seasons, and a Chi-square test to determine if weather depends on the season. The
            test assumptions and p-values are examined to make decisions on whether to accept or reject null hypotheses, and
            conclusions are drawn based on these results. The quality of the notebook is assessed based on structure, flow, and well-
            commented code, and the overall evaluation criteria encompass problem definition, EDA, hypothesis testing, and notebook
            quality.</p>

          <h3>Project 6: Business Case: Delhivery - Feature Engineering</h3>
          <p>In this Delhivery business case, the objective is to process and analyze data from their data engineering pipelines to create
            useful features for forecasting models. The dataset includes information on trip details, route types, time taken, and more. The
            analysis begins with basic data cleaning, including handling missing values and merging rows to create meaningful
            aggregations based on trip identifiers. Features are then extracted from destination and source names, as well as trip creation
            timestamps. In-depth analysis and feature engineering involve calculating time differences, conducting hypothesis testing, and
            visual analysis on various time and distance-related fields after aggregation. Outliers are identified and treated using the IQR
            method, categorical variables are one-hot encoded, and numerical features are normalized or standardized. The evaluation
            criteria include problem definition, EDA, feature creation, row merging, time and distance field comparison, missing values,
            outlier treatment, relationship between aggregated fields, handling categorical values, and column
            normalization/standardization. Insights and recommendations are provided, such as identifying order origins, busiest
            corridors, average distances, and time taken, along with actionable business suggestions. The goal is to transform raw data
            into actionable insights to improve Delhivery's operations.</p>

          <h3>Project 7: Business Case: Jamboree Education - Linear Regression</h3>
          <p>In this Jamboree Education business case, the goal is to analyse graduate admissions data and understand the key factors
            influencing admission chances, ultimately building a linear regression model for predictions. The dataset includes attributes
            such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rating, and statement of purpose and recommendation strength, undergraduate
            GPA, research experience, and chance of admission. The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA), including data
            structure assessment, missing value treatment, and statistical summary. Univariate and bivariate analyses provide insights
            into the data distribution and variable relationships. Data pre-processing involves checking for duplicates, addressing missing
            values, treating outliers, and feature engineering. A linear regression model is built; with model, statistics and coefficients
            displayed, and Ridge and Lasso regression are explored. The assumptions of the linear regression model, such as
            multicollinearity, mean of residuals, linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals, are rigorously tested. Model
            performance is evaluated using metrics like MAE, RMSE, R2, and adjusted R2, with a focus on train and test performances.
            Actionable insights and recommendations are provided, emphasizing the significance of predictor variables and potential
            business benefits. The submission includes a Jupyter notebook converted to PDF format for assessment</p>

          <h3>Project 8: Business Case: Mindset</h3>
          <p>The problem at hand is to address the high churn rate of drivers in Ola, where it is costly to acquire new drivers, and retaining
            existing ones is more cost-effective. As a data scientist in Ola's Analytics Department, the task involves predicting driver
            attrition based on various driver attributes such as demographics, tenure, and historical performance data for 2019 and 2020.
            The steps for a successful solution include data pre-processing, feature engineering, class imbalance treatment,
            standardization, and encoding. Ensemble learning methods like Bagging and Boosting will be applied with hyper-parameter
            tuning. Evaluation metrics will include a ROC AUC curve and a Classification Report. The insights derived from exploratory
            data analysis will focus on data distributions, relationships between variables, and potential outliers. Based on the analysis,
            actionable recommendations will be provided to mitigate driver attrition and improve Ola's driver retention strategy.
            Additionally, a link to the Jupyter notebook in PDF format with all the analysis and results will be shared for review</p>
